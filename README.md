## Results

Here is an example of it competiting against the much larger (most likley around 250 times larger) OpenAI GPT-4 model:

**Prompt**: Summarize and analyze the following article focusing on the breakdown of perimeter defenses, social engineering campaigns, and the exploitation of edge devices: [report](http://arcticwolf.com/resource/_pfcdn/assets/preprocessed/10926/b077a271-4d17-4430-b858-4275a983ed2a/b077a271-4d17-4430-b858-4275a983ed2a.pdf)

## GPT-4

### Breakdown of Perimeter Defenses
- **Expanded Attack Surface**: 
  - The shift towards cloud infrastructure, IoT devices, and remote work has transformed enterprise perimeters, leading to increased vulnerabilities.
- **Edge Device Exploitation**:
  - Threat actors exploit misconfigurations and software vulnerabilities in VPN gateways, IoT devices, and security tools.
  - Example: Rapid exploitation of vulnerabilities in SonicWall VPN devices.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Maintain detailed inventories of devices.
  - Implement continuous vulnerability management.
  - Enhance endpoint visibility and network segmentation.

### Social Engineering Campaigns
- **Increasing Sophistication**:
  - Threat actors leverage crises and generative AI to craft more convincing phishing lures and deepfakes.
  - AI enables advanced voice phishing ("vishing") and video manipulation for identity deception.
- **Two-Stage Attacks**:
  - Exploit system outages to launch phishing campaigns promising remediation.

### Exploitation of Edge Devices
- **Edge Vulnerabilities**:
  - Devices like IP cameras, VoIP, and industrial IoT gateways are increasingly targeted due to poor built-in security and lack of regular updates.
- **Quick Turnaround**:
  - Adversaries rapidly execute attacks, such as deploying ransomware within hours of gaining access.

### Insights
- Threat actors are adapting to evolving IT environments, leveraging misconfigurations and human error to breach defenses.
- AI is a dual challenge, empowering both defenders and adversaries.
- Edge devices and identity management systems are critical vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for layered security and proactive measures.

## Cybersecurity-Assistant 

### 1. Breakdown of Perimeter Defenses  
**Key Insights**:  
- Traditional security perimeters are eroding due to remote work, cloud adoption, and IoT expansion.  
- VPN gateways and edge devices (e.g., IP cameras, IoT gateways) are prime targets for exploitation.  
- **Case Example**: Akira ransomware affiliates compromised SonicWall VPNs within 2 hours in 2024.  
- Manufacturing organizations are disproportionately impacted (44% of Arctic Wolf’s 2024 incident cases).  

**Recommendations**:  
- Prioritize **continuous vulnerability management**, especially for perimeter-facing devices.  
- Implement **network segmentation** to limit lateral movement post-breach.  
- Monitor VPN and firewall logs for anomalies.  
- Maintain an updated inventory of all edge devices.  

### 2. Social Engineering Campaigns: AI-Driven Evolution  
**Key Insights**:  
- Generative AI enables hyper-realistic phishing, vishing, and deepfake attacks.  
- Adversaries exploit crises (e.g., CrowdStrike’s 2024 IT outage) to impersonate service providers.  
- **Case Example**: Axios phishing campaign used adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) techniques to bypass MFA.  

**Recommendations**:  
- Deploy **phishing-resistant MFA** (e.g., FIDO2/WebAuthn standards).  
- Conduct regular **security awareness training** and phishing simulations.  
- Integrate SaaS logs (e.g., Microsoft 365, Okta) for detection of suspicious activity.  
- Use email security tools (e.g., Mimecast, Barracuda) to flag external emails.  

### 3. Exploitation of Edge Devices  
**Key Insights**:  
- Edge devices (e.g., medical devices, industrial IoT) often lack built-in security.  
- Weak credentials, unpatched firmware, and default configurations are common entry points.  
- Nation-state actors target critical infrastructure (e.g., energy, healthcare) to establish persistence for hybrid conflicts.  

**Recommendations**:  
- Enforce **strict credential hygiene** and geolocation-based access controls.  
- Adopt the **3-2-1 backup strategy**: 3 copies, 2 locations, 1 off-site.  
- Conduct penetration testing to identify edge device vulnerabilities.  
- Partner with **Managed Detection and Response (MDR)** providers for 24/7 monitoring.  

### Conclusion  
The 2025 threat landscape demands a shift from reactive to **anticipatory security practices**:  
- Evolve perimeter defenses with **zero-trust principles** and continuous monitoring.  
- Build a culture of security awareness to counter AI-driven social engineering.  
- Strengthen edge device security through rigorous asset management and patching. 

**Foundational Best Practices**:  
- Maintain system inventories.  
- Prioritize patch management.  
- Test disaster recovery plans regularly.
